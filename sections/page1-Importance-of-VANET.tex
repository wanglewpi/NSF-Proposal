Page 1 Importance of Communications with Autonomous Vehicles

\markup{RI: I modified this based on PPT used on previous meeting}


The research objectives of this project include studies of data source selection, of 
trajectory planning algorithms and performance limitations under communication latency and package error, and of 
packet receive by trajectory planning and control requirements.
\tbl{tbl-objectives} provides a detailed list of technical objectives, along with 
the anticipated outcomes of pursuing them. 
In \scn{sec-tech-approach}, we provide definitions 
of the terms related to ``safety'' mentioned in \tbl{tbl-objectives}.
The scientific and 
engineering outcomes listed in \tbl{tbl-objectives} are expected to be strongly dependent -- 
and the proposed work will characterize these dependencies -- on 
the vehicle's forward speed, driving conditions (e.g. road topography and road surface), 
traffic conditions (e.g. average number of other vehicles per unit distance per lane, average 
speed of other vehicles), and driving maneuver (e.g. left/right turn, lane-keeping).
