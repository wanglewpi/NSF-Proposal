SAE standards are made for the safety messages. SAE J2735 defines 15 types of safety messages such as Basic Safety Messages (BSM), Signal Phase Time (SPT) and MAP message. 

Specially, BSM is broadcast periodically in 10Hz announcing state information such as position, speed, acceleration and heading direction etc. The BSM message is mandatory in DSRC that all vehicles need to broadcast to nearby cars. 

In addition to the regular safety messages, BSM can be also used to transmit control messages. For the emergency channels, i.e., Ch. 172 and Ch. 184, BSM can convey power control information to coordinate the transmission power on each channel. On the other hand, the BSM can be used as the inputs of the vehicle control algorithms. The control messages are transmitted among the vehicles within the range. 

The propose is to use this information to use as input for the power control algorithm and the  control algorithms inside the car.
